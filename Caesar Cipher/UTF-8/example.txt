If Skadi embraces her Seaborn blood, Ishar'mla's rage will be finally unleashed along with the provokation of the plankton-like Firstborn, the "Primordial Lifespring," hence bringing the so-called the "second" Profound Silence across the entire Terra. He will not only flood the whole world, but also kill every being upon the land. Even the mightiest powers in Terra such as Ursus' Emperor's Blades, Kazimierz's Knight Orders, Yan's greatest Tianshi, and Columbia's latest technologies could not withstand His devouring waves and the multiplying swarms of Sea Terrors. Other ancient beings like the Feranmuts, the Beast Lords, and even Kal'tsit alone will find it hard to calm Ishar'mla down.[2] On the other hand, the feelings of comfort and safety the Doctor gave to Skadi were passed on to Ishar'mla who in turn spares them from the disaster, and He will keep yearning for them to join the Seaborn's hive mind until the day they eventually surrendered themselves to Him. When everything has settled, the fully reborn Ishar'mla will then lead His kin away from Terra and soar towards the outer space in search for a new habitat.
