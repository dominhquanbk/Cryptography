# Cipher Tools

This repository contains implementations of two classic ciphers: Caesar Cipher and Rail Fence Cipher.

## Caesar Cipher

The Caesar Cipher is a substitution cipher where each letter in the plaintext is shifted a certain number of places down or up the alphabet.

### Files

- `caesar.py`: Python script containing the implementation of the Caesar Cipher.
- `word_alpha.txt`: A text file containing a list of English words, used for reference or testing purposes.
- `example.txt`: A text file for plain text input

### Usage

To use the Caesar Cipher implementation:
1. Ensure you have Python installed on your system.
2. Run `caesar.py` and follow the instructions provided within the script.
3. remember to edit the path to the file

## Rail Fence Cipher

The Rail Fence Cipher is a transposition cipher that writes plaintext in a zigzag pattern on multiple lines.

### Files

- `railfence.py`: Python script containing the implementation of the Rail Fence Cipher.

### Usage

To use the Rail Fence Cipher implementation:
1. Ensure you have Python installed on your system.
2. Run `railfence.py` and follow the instructions provided within the script.
